		&emsp; Magnificent is a word that describes a person or object that is great in deed or exalted in place. Now this word can take a name or word that it describes, and take it to a whole new level. For example, magnificent is a word that only former famous rulers would get, like Lorenzo the Magnificent or Joasaph the Magnificent. Both of these leaders did something extraordinary that brought about this name of glory. Now the question is, what can we do as a pilgrim to be magnificent, like the greats? I will tell you. To be someone magnificent, take time out of your day to say hello to someone in the hall. Hold the door open for your peers. Spend time with someone who never really seems to fit somewhere. Being a pilgrim means being magnificent.
