		&emsp; Radiant means “emitting light”. It sounds similar to radioactive. If being a pilgrim means being radiant, we need to all turn into the Hulk. We are radioactive. All joking aside, radiance still means “beam, emit light.” To be radiant metaphorically means that we are a light to others. In Matthew 14, Jesus told us to be a light. Being radiant isn’t being a radioactive person, but being an example to others, and a guide. A prime example is being a missionary. As a missionary you hold Christ’s light, you are radiant. On top of that, being a light is also guiding others to the right path. When being a PILGRIM means being Radiant, that means being a positive example to
		others.
