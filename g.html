		&emsp; Generous means showing kindness to others so a way that a Pilgrim can be generous is that they can hold the door open for people. How opening the door for other people would be generous is that someone could be having a bad day and you go and open the door for them, it could cheer up their mood. Another way to be generous to someone is to smile at them and say hello and nice other things to them to cheer up their mood. Why that would be important is because some people just need support throughout the day and that could make them feel better. That is what a Pilgrim would look like being generous.
