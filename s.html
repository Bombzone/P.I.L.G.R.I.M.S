		&emsp; Being strategic is finding ways to do things differently and with more efficiency. Being strategic as a pilgrim means that we as pilgrims find different ways to do things better than others, and we use our brain to find ways to be more efficient than others in school and out of school. We as pilgrims find more strategic ways to do things others wouldn't.
