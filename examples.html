				In an assembly:

			<div class="content">
				&emsp; Being a Pilgrim during assemblies means radiating good energy and being lively and present in the moment. Being lively and awake during assemblies will help them be funner and more exciting.<br>
				&emsp; For example, when the students are feeling drained and tired, it can only take one person radiating good, alive energy to lift them up and make them get more into and excited about the assembly. Students are more likely to behave better when they are livelier and more radiant.

				In the classroom:
			</h2>
			<div class="content">
				&emsp; Being a pilgrim in the classroom is having perseverance and being intelligent.<br>
				&emsp; For example, perseverance in the classroom is not giving up. When your teacher gives you work and you don't know how to do it, instead of not doing it ask for help or work through it. Having intelligence in the classroom can be shown as answering questions that the teacher has.You could also help other students if needed. There are multiple ways you can be a pilgrim in the classroom.

		<div class="sports">
			<h2>
				In sports:
			</h2>
			<div class="content">
				&emsp; Being a Pilgrim in sports means having integrity and being strategic. In sports you have to be strategic in order to win the game.<br>
				&emsp; For example, in football you have a playbook. It has all the plays for your team in order to be successful. You also have to have integrity in sports so people know your team is truthful.<br>
				&emsp; For another example, in volleyball you receive the ball and you get three hits and on the third hit you hit the ball and it bounces outside of the line. Say the line judge doesn't see it, they would ask your team if it was in or out. If you have integrity then you would tell them that it was out.

			<h2>
				On the bus:
			</h2>
			<div class="content">
				&emsp; When on the bus, pilgrims need to show honesty, respect, and kindness. These are three things that can make the bus an amazing ride to school for all the little pilgrims.<br>
				&emsp; Once upon a time there were tons and tons of little children that rode the bus to school. There was one particular child named Ricky. This particular child used to be bullied by all of his classmates when he would get on the bus because he was the smallest kid in their grade. These little students are called pilgrims. But one day after weeks of this boy being teased on the bus, one special little pilgrim stood up for the boy. It was the most miraculous thing ever, after that boy named Bobby stood up for Ricky, everyone on the bus realized that they all needed to be friends to succeed.

				In extra curricular activities:
			</h2>
			<div class="content">
				&emsp; We have many Extra Curricular activities here at New Plymouth. The one that I am going to talk about is FFA. With FFA we show all of these qualities that make a pilgrim. We show the qualities in FFA by going to FFA events and going to FFA banquets. In preparation for the banquets and events we persevere to be the best and practice many times a week. We sacrifice our lunches to practice for these events. We also gain intelligence from these practices and we learn something new every day. We show this new intelligence that we have in people around us. We also use this new intelligence to maybe start a career in agriculture or to work in agriculture in the future. FFA members are also very lively. They are very nice and generous. At the Payette social the FFA members from New Plymouth participate in everything and are loud. They also are very generous by inviting others around them to join in this game. We are just a joy to everyone around us. Our light is very radiant and you know that we are pilgrims. We act differently than the other members. The New Plymouth FFA member also has integrity, we are different, we stand up for those around us. We try to be different and be better. We are magnificent and everyone knows that we are pilgrims. We are also very strategic in having a plan and we try to bring our knowledge. We plan to be the best.
